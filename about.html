                                    <li>Dusky grouse live primarily along the southern, into central, border of Canada dipping down into the northern United States and spanning nearly from west to east coast. Keeping primarily to the rocky and appalacian mountatain ranges in the U.S. their range has shrunk significantly in the past few decades. Dusky grouse live mostly along forest edges and in new growth forests, preferring groves of small trees with lots of cover. During the winter they are often found in coniferous trees where they feed in the winter months.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Their diet consists mostly of vegetation. This includes leaves, conifer needles, buds, flowers and berries. They are also know to eat insects on occasion, though rarely as a primary food source. Young grouse are known to consume more insects than adults. Although their regular diet may seem fairly simple, grouse eating frogs, snakes and salamanders have also been on record. </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>The largest threat to all grouse worldwide is deforestation and lack of habitat. As more forests in northern America as cut down or developed, there becomes less and less space for grouse to live in and repopulate. On a smaller scale, grouse have many predators. They are often hunted by other birds such as gray owls and goshawks, and regularly hunted by ground dwelling animals as well such as bobcats, wolves and coyotes. Grouse has also been a staple game bird for centuries for humans living across their range.</li>
